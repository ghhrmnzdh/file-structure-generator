# File Structure Generator

A Python script to dynamically generate file structures based on user input. Perfect for developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts to quickly create organized project templates. Supports nested directories, customizable inputs, and AI-generated structures. 🚀

---

## Features
- **Dynamic File Structure Creation**: Generate directories and files from a multi-line string input.
- **Nested Structures**: Supports deeply nested directory hierarchies.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the input to match your project's needs.
- **AI Integration**: Replicate file structures generated by AI models like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot.
- **Lightweight**: No dependencies—just pure Python.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DeepSeekAI/file-structure-generator.git
   cd file-structure-generator
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or higher).

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python file_structure_generator.py
   ```

---

## Usage

### Step 1: Define Your File Structure
Modify the `file_structure` variable in the `file_structure_generator.py` script to match your desired structure. Use the following format:
- Lines ending with `/` are treated as **directories**.
- Other lines are treated as **files**.
- Use indentation (4 spaces) to define nested structures.

Example:
```python
file_structure = """
project-name/
│
├── README.md               # Project documentation
├── main.py                 # Main script
├── utils/                  # Utility functions
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── file_utils.py       # File handling utilities
│   └── math_utils.py       # Math utilities
│
└── tests/                  # Test cases
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_utils.py       # Tests for utility functions
"""
```

### Step 2: Run the Script
Execute the script to generate the file structure:
```bash
python file_structure_generator.py
```

## AI-Generated File Structures

With the rise of AI, many tools and models (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) can generate file structures for specific projects. This script can be used to quickly replicate those structures locally. For example:

1. Ask an AI model: *"Generate a file structure for a Python web application."*
2. Copy the output into the `file_structure` variable in the script.
3. Run the script to create the structure.

This makes it easy to bring AI-generated ideas to life!

## Why Use This Tool?

### Save Time
Manually creating directories and files for a new project can be tedious. This tool automates the process, allowing you to focus on writing code instead of setting up folders.

### Stay Organized
A well-structured project is easier to navigate and maintain. This tool ensures consistency across your projects, whether you're working alone or in a team.

### AI Integration
AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are becoming increasingly popular for generating project templates. This script allows you to quickly replicate those templates, saving you even more time.

### No Dependencies
The script is written in pure Python, so you don’t need to install any additional libraries. Just clone the repository and start using it!
